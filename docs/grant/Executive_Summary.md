# Executive Summary – Project Poly

**Project Name:** Poly  
**Project Lead:** Reya McVay  
**Stage:** Phase 1 – Open-source MVP following Shipwright lessons  
**Repository:** [GitHub – Poly](https://github.com/ladym0d/Poly)

---

### Overview
Poly is an open-source AI collaboration framework that bridges creative tools, real-time data, and language-model guidance. Building on lessons from the Shipwright MVP, Poly Phase 1 focuses on creating a “Programming Mentor” mode for Blender that helps independent developers, educators, and artists work faster and learn AI-assisted development skills.

---

### Problem / Need
Independent creators and small teams often lack access to the kind of AI-assisted development tools available in large organizations. Existing solutions are fragmented, closed, or prohibitively expensive. There is a need for an open, transparent, and modular framework that makes AI co-creation practical and accessible.

---

### Solution
Poly demonstrates how open-source AI can integrate directly with creative software.  
The MVP will:  
- Provide real-time guidance and feedback for coding inside Blender.  
- Relay data and events through a lightweight Python/WebSocket layer.  
- Enable transparent logs, overlays, and documentation suitable for education and reproducible research.

---

### Impact
Poly lowers barriers to AI literacy and creative technology education.  
It empowers independent developers, students, and artists to learn through doing, while ensuring all code, data, and methods remain public and auditable.

---

### Funding Request
We are seeking micro-grant support to:  
- Expand the MVP’s Blender integration to support real-time overlays.  
- Develop public documentation, diagrams, and community onboarding materials.  
- Conduct a pilot test with open-source contributors and educators.  

Estimated range: **$5,000 – $25,000** (depending on scope and partner collaboration).
