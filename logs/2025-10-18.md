# ðŸ§­ Poly Daily Log â€” 2025-10-19

## Summary
Finalized the continuous integration (CI) setup and implemented a manual daily log script for streamlined project tracking. The repository is now stable, synced, and verified clean for future grant preparation.

## Tasks Worked On
- Fixed YAML syntax errors in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Validated CI pipeline for Python and Node environments
- Confirmed successful workflow run on main branch (âœ…)
- Created `scripts/new-log.sh` for manual daily log creation
- Updated `.gitignore` to allow Markdown logs
- Synced local + remote branches via `rebase` and `push`

## Notes & Decisions
- CI pipeline is now passing and stable.
- `new-log.sh` creates `/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with a project template and auto-commits it.
- Logging remains **manual by design**, to match flexible development pacing.
- CI badge can now be added to the README for funder visibility.
- Repository cleaned and verified for GrantAI readiness.

## Next Steps
- Add CI badge to top of `README.md`
- Review and update `/docs/grant/` folder (Executive Summary, One-Page, Budget)
- Polish `README` narrative and roadmap for funding submission
- Begin GrantAI alignment review and one-page prep
