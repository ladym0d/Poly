# 2025-10-26 — Poly Tutor MVP Achieved 🎉

**Milestone:**  
First successful interactive teaching loop between Poly and Blender 2.79.

**Summary:**  
Poly verbally instructed the user to add and move a cube in Blender, detected success, and responded verbally using SSML.  
This marks the completion of the **Poly Tutor MVP**, demonstrating real-time AI teaching and verification on low-power hardware.

**Setup:**  
- Blender 2.79  
- `poly_hook v0.4b`  
- PowerShell + `Send-Poly` helper  
- Windows TTS voice output  
- Surface Pro 7 (Windows 11)

**Next Steps:**  
- Record demo with OBS
