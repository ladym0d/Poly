# 2025-10-19 â€” Poly MVP Demo (Surface Pro 7)

## Progress
- Completed clean OBS Portable install and configuration (720p/15 fps).  
- Installed Python 3.13.7 and verified library stack:  
  `openai`, `websockets`, `pyautogui`.  
- Created working environment under `C:\PolyDemo` with:
  - `poly_hook.py`
  - `poly_cli.py`
  - `poly_config.example.json`
  - `logs/` directory for session data.  
- Installed and configured Blender 2.79b.  
- Resolved path and permission issues for `blender.exe`.  
- Verified hook operation via PowerShell and `.bat` launcher:

- Confirmed Blender + hook stable and responsive on SP7.  
- Windows shortcut pinning drops launch arguments (expected under Program Files); `.bat` launcher confirmed reliable alternative.  
- OBS Portable confirmed lightweight and stable at demo settings.

## Next Steps
- Begin **Poly CLI test**:
- Confirm socket communication from `poly_cli.py` to `poly_hook.py`.
- Validate Blender response (`add cube`, `move x`).
- Capture OBS demo footage and verify `demo_log.jsonl` output.

## Notes
Environment confirmed operational on Surface Pro 7 with minimal resource load.  
Next milestone: integrate CLI + OBS for grant-ready MVP demo footage.
